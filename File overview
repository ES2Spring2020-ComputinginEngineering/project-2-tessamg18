FILE OVERVIEW:

This repository includes several files. 

The README.md file is an overview of all of the function included in this repository. 
Before testing code, this file should be read in order to understand the basic gist
of each custom function. 

The ckd.csv is a file with data inside of it. 
It has hemoglobin and glucose levels along with the known classification. This is the training set
that will be used for all of the following files.

The nearestneighborsclassification.py contains code to run nearest neighbors algorithm, 
as well as K-nearest neighbors. It contains both custom functions and main script. 

The kmeansclustering_functions.py contains custom functions that are intended to run a 
k-means clustering algorithm. A general overview of the functions in this file is provided
in the README.md file mentioned above. This file is meant to be used in tandem with 
the following file:

Kmeansclustering_driver.py. This file is the main script for the k-means clustering algorithm. 
It imports all of the functions from kmeansclustering_functions.
